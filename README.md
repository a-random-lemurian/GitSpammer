# GitSpammer
GitSpammer is a Python application for creating empty Git commits and branches. If you need to ask why you would want this, see the `Intended uses` section.

# Install
Mac/Linux/Unix-like: Copy-paste these commands into a directory of your choice.
```
git clone https://github.com/a-random-lemurian/GitSpammer.git
cd GitSpammer
pip install --editable .
```

# Intended uses
- Create fake commits, fake branches structured just like your actual Git repository to test out a command you think is too risky to blindly perform on your real repository.
- Play around with Git commands.
## But please don't use me for:
- Spamming actual repositories (that's not nice).

# Disclaimer
GitSpammer is **not associated in any way with the maintainers of the Git source control management system.** GitSpammer is a tool intended for experimentation with Git. The intended use of the tool is listed in `Intended uses`.
